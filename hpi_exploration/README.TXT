Purpose of the project
The goal of this project is to analyze and gain some insights into the trends and patterns present in the house price index in Virginia over the years. 
The house price index (HPI) is a measure of how much the price of single-family homes have changed over time. 
Using the pandas library and SQL tools, we can gain insights into the patterns and changes that the housing market has seen and how the different states compare. 
It is also beneficial for the data to be stored in a SQL database for security and scalability. 
In short, the overall purpose is to give a better understanding of the housing market for homeowners and homebuyers.

The .ipynb file reads the data and converts it to a SQL database
The sql file queries the percent change in HPI between 2017 and 2022
The R file creates visualizations using ggplot, the output is 'hpi_plot.png'
The 'hpi_map.png' image file was created in Tableau, using state_data.csv created in the ipynb file

The dataset is provided by FHFA and can be downloaded at https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx#mpo
