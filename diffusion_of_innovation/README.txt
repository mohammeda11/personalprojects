Diffusion of innovation is the theory and process in which new ideas are spread throughout
a population. This behavior can be modeled in many different ways using software such as
Python. The primary reason for doing so is to see how well an idea or product is adopted or
discarded by consumers. However, it may also explain why an idea is spread the way it is. This
paper focuses on the diffusion of innovation process using iPad sales data between 2010 and
2017. The methods of modeling used are Python, R and NetLogo. Observing and comparing
the results show us the uniqueness of each model representing the diffusion of innovation of the
same product.
