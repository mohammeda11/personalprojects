The aim of this project is to see the correlation and
relationship between the state and production of agriculture and
a populations’ access to food. The data was collected from the
Food Environment Atlas provided by the Economic Research
Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. The
Atlas records these variables at a county-level, where each row
represents a county in the United States. By using Python and the
Pandas library, the dataset was cleaned and converted to a state-
level. Using JMP Pro 15 to get the correlation and relationship
between the variables, we can see that there is no significant
relationship between food access and agriculture despite other
similar studies’ results. This begs the question of what other
indicators, either in the original raw data or data provided by
another party, have an effect on our accessibility to food, if any.
